# Kaltura Room Manager Sample

This shows how to create an interface to manage Kaltura Meetings rooms in a Node.js application.
This is a very basic node express based app (generated using [Express Generator](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html)).

## To run
1. Checkout/Download the files
1. `npm install`
1. Copy `config.template.json` to `config.json`
1. Open `config.json`, configure according to the instructions and remove all comments
1. Run:
   * On Mac/Linux - `DEBUG=kalturaroommanager:* npm start`
   * Windows - `set DEBUG=myapp:* & npm start`
1. Load http://localhost:3000/ in your browser to access the app.

## How this code works?
* express is configured with two routes: index and updaterooms
* index (/) - the homepage shows a table of existing rooms (resources) and some of their attributes including room name, description and tags.
* updaterooms updates the rooms that were checked in the table

## TO DO
* Security audit - e.g. input validation is not yet done.
* Add paging, sorting and filtering to the UI.
* Add support for more than 500 resources via paging.
* Implement an admin login flow instead of using API secret in the config - will be more secured and will also allow for audit on who did what in case of issues.
* Tags field should have some input validation to ensure no faulty data is entered and only valid tags are added.
